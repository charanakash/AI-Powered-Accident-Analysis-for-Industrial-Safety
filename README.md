# AI-Powered Accident Analysis for Industrial Safety

### **Also, please read the project report for more details

## Situation:

- Industrial accidents are a significant issue worldwide, causing injuries, fatalities, and production disruptions.
- Understanding the root causes of these accidents is crucial for improving safety protocols and preventing future occurrences.
- A large dataset containing anonymized accident records from various plants across different countries was available.

## Task:
 
- Develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) based chatbot to analyze accident descriptions and identify key risk factors.
- Use the chatbot to promote communication and knowledge sharing about industrial safety practices.
- Equip employees with the ability to identify and report potential hazards in their work environment.

## Action:

- Preprocessed the accident data, including text cleaning, tokenization, and stemming/lemmatization.
- Trained a machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines) to classify accident descriptions based on risk factors (e.g., equipment failure, human error, unsafe work practices).
- Developed a chatbot interface using a platform or framework for chatbot development.
- Integrated the NLP model that has been trained into the chatbot to identify risk factors by taking accident descriptions from users.
- Designed the conversation flow of the chatbot to take users step-by-step through the process of reporting and also offering safety information.
- Implemented functionality in the chatbot, which would answer frequently asked questions about safety procedures and regulations.

## Outcome:

- Developed an NLP-driven chatbot that effectively analyses descriptions of accidents and finds relevant risk factors.
- I ensured a user-friendly reporting portal for employees to submit reports on accidents and also avail safety information.
- I ensured employee awareness and engagement in safety through communication with the chatbot, which was interactive in nature.
- This would mean possible prevention of future accidents, as employees are enabled to identify and report hazards beforehand.
